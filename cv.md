## About Me

For the last 7 years I have worked as a marketer. At the beginning of 2020, I decided to go into development, as I always liked this activity and wrote code and studied relevant materials at my leisure. 

At the moment I am studying at RS School on the Javascript / Front-end course, gaining experience, pumping my knowledge. I get much more pleasure from work and study than from my previous job. I really like to sit and figure out the code, solve problems and make layout from scratch.

The goal is to become a full-stack developer in a year.
In the evenings I watch a lot of videos on the topic. Full immersion)
